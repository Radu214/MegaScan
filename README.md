# MegaScan

**MegaScanPay** is a mobile app that enhances the in-store shopping experience at **Mega Image**. With this app, users can scan products directly with their phone camera, add them to a digital cart, and pay seamlesslyâ€”skipping the checkout lines. The app also provides personalized product recommendations based on available offers using a cosine similarity algorithm.

> This project was built in just **24 hours** during the **HackITall** hackathon, for the AD/01 sponsor.

## How Recommendations Work

MegaScanPay uses a cosine similarity algorithm to suggest relevant offers by analyzing shopping behavior and current promotions.

- The system identifies customers with shopping patterns similar to yours.
- It compares your scanned products with their purchase history using cosine similarity.
- Products frequently bought by similar users, but not yet in your cart, are given a relevance score.
- If those products are also part of current store promotions, they are recommended to you as personalized deals.
